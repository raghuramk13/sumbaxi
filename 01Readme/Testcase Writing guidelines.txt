1. Definations:

	Given : Always represents Prerequisite for testcase
	When : Always represents Actions to be performed by Actor/User for performing test case
	Then : Always represents Verification or out come of the action performed by Actor/User	
	And : Used to add two or more When/Then (steps/verification) statements in single go.

Following guidelines to be followed for writing Test cases
	1. Every Testcase should be grouped under 'Feature'
	2. Testcase Name should represent Objective of Respective Testcase
	3. Prerequisite: should always start with 'Given'
	4. Navigation Key: This represents steps to navigate to Prerequisite
	5. Description : Define clear objective of testcase. Also include any asumptions that testcase assumes
	5. Steps : Should start with 'When'. If there are more than one step then all the subsequent steps should start with 'And' on new line
	6. Expected result: Should Start with 'Then'. If there are more than one Verification for respective step then all the subsequent verifications should start with 'And' on new line
	
	7. When stetament secentance can be formed with below general logic
		Who is performing Action + What Action + Which Object + Any Input Data to be passed. 
		
	8. Then statement secentance can be formed with below general logic
		""Verify" + Which Object to verify +  What To Verify + Expected Data. 

	9. Put all the Notes in square bracket as [Note: Some note...]
